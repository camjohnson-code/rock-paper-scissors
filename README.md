# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a fun Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a fun and interactive game with a unique hard mode featuring additional options—fire and water.

## Challenges

One of the hardest challenges I faced was the implementation of the logo color change when hovering. I went into this project thinking SVGs could be styled in CSS similar to text. Once I learned that is not the case, I had to explore a different solution. I ended up creating two SVGs in my HTML — one a solid white color, and the other a gradient. I then used Javascript to hide/unhide them when hovering. 

## Wins
- Successfully incorporating a hard mode with unique elements was a significant win. It adds a layer of excitement for players familiar with the classic Rock Paper Scissors.
- Self teaching and implementing media queries for screen size responsiveness.


## Setup Instructions
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- In your terminal, `cd` into the directory.
- Run `open index.html`.
- Start playing and enjoy the game!
